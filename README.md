# Crowdfunding_ETL



## Decription

There are two components to this ETL project.  First, we used Python and Pandas to import excel, transform and clean the data, and place them into dataframes.  We then extracted the dataframs into csv files, which can be found in the resources folder.  

Next, we sketched out an ERD for the 4 tables, defining the relationships, the data types, and the keys.  We used this ERD to create a postgres database with 4 tables.  Next, we imported the csv file for each corresponding table.  Last, we verfied the data by running select all statements for each table.
